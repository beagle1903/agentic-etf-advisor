# Agentic ETF Advisor

An educational, source-grounded US ETF portfolio decision-support project built with
LangGraph. The project is designed as a sequence of small, testable vertical slices.

The first slice validates an investor profile, drafts a deterministic policy range,
pauses for human review, and only then finalizes the result. Live ETF retrieval, model
providers, GraphRAG, and the dashboard are intentionally introduced in later slices.

> It does not execute trades. Market data can be incomplete, delayed, or incorrect.

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.12 or 3.13, `uv`, Git, and optionally Docker Desktop.

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run etf-advisor demo
```

The demo pauses at a LangGraph human-review interrupt and then resumes with an automatic
approval so the complete lifecycle is visible from the terminal.

Start the local data services:

```powershell
docker compose up -d chroma neo4j postgres
docker compose ps
```

Chroma is available at `http://localhost:8000`, Neo4j Browser at
`http://localhost:7474` (Bolt at `neo4j://localhost:17687`), and PostgreSQL at
`localhost:5432`. Ports are bound to the local machine only. The Neo4j host port is
remapped because this Windows machine reserves the standard `7687` port.
